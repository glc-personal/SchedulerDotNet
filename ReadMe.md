## Summary
This project is a simple collaboration project with the main goal of creating a simple web app for generating
optimal schedules for employees and employers based on the needs of the employer along with the availability of
each employee.

- To-Do

## Notes
It is important to prioritize user availability, but in the end the work needs to be done, so employer needs 
will take precedence over the availability of the employees if necessary. But this behavior is not 
implemented and will not be implemented, it will be up to the manager to modify the generated work schedule
to fill in any missing times.
